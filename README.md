# Billiards-Board-Simulation

The following program simulates a billiards table where the ball moves at 45 degree angle with elastic collision. 
The program also specifies the number of times the ball's path intersects a random line (user specified). 
The total number of collisions is width + length - 2 where width and length are relatively prime. 

Instructions to run the code:
1. Click run
2. Enter the values of width of the table, length of the table, point1’s x-location, point1’s y-location, point2’s xlocation,
point2’ y-location
3. The values should be entered with spaces between each other
